### LDAP Injection Prevention

##### Distinguished Name (DN) Escaping:
There are certain characters that are considered special characters in a DN.
The exhaustive [list](src/main/java/FilterHelper.java:5) is the following:

`\` `#` `+` `<` `>` `,` `;` `"` `=` and leading or trailing spaces.

Some "special" characters that are allowed in Distinguished Names and do not need to be escaped include:
`*` `(` `)` `.` `&` `-` `_` `[` `]` `` ~` `|` `@` `$` `%` `^` `?` `:` `{` `}` `!` `'`

Let's create a [isValidLoginInput](src/main/java/FilterHelper.java:10-13) method to validate user's input.
